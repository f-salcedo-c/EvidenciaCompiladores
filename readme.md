The purpose of this repository is to showcase our capstone project by building an interpreter that parses instructions following grammatical rules.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Libraries:
  - networkx
  - ply
  - matplotlib

### Usage
- Run the translator with continuous or fixed input from a file.
- To run continuous input, execute the script `translator.py` from the command line. Type your commands and hit ENTER to get the evaluation. Type ‘exit’ to finish the execution.
- To run fixed input, execute the script `translator.py` from the command line and provide your file as an argument. Example ‘.parse’ files can be found in the examples folder.
